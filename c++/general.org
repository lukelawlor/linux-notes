* Variables
** Initialization
There are three ways to initialize variables:
#+begin_src c++
  // Copy initialization
  int width = 5;

  // Direct initialization
  int width( 5 );

  // Brace initialization (modern)
  int width {5};
#+end_src
* STL
** cout
#+begin_src c++
  // Disable the buffering of std::cout
  std::cout << std::unitbuf;
#+end_src
