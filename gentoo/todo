X use software cursor
	2.20.23
	Causes problems with redshift. Makes the cursor not follow blue light filter.

	To fix, run 
	$ grep 'autoconfigured driver' /var/log/Xorg.0.log
	$ grep 'Creating default Display subsection in Screen section' /var/log/Xorg.0.log

	First command shows list of autoconfigured drivers
	Second command show which driver was used to make the default display

	Example second command output: 
	[    10.134] (II) DRIVERNAME(0): Creating default Display subsection in Screen section

	DRIVERNAME is the driver name. It may be a truncated form of one of the drivers from the first command.

	Create a .conf file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ and write these contents

	Section "Device"
		Identifier "My Graphics Card"
		Driver "DRIVERNAME"
		Option "SWcursor" "on"
	EndSection

	Restart X and enjoy
