Setting up Vulkan on Gentoo

First I followed the steps from here:
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Vulkan

My VIDEO_CARDS is set to "amdgpu radeonsi" so to install Vulkan drivers I just had to re-emerge media-libs/mesa with the vulkan USE flag.

I still had to deal with 2 more things before getting Vulkan to work.

1: I had to make sure my user was in the group that owned the graphics card devices in /dev/dri. In this case, the cards were owned by the vglusers group.

2: I had to use the amdgpu kernel module instead of the radeon module

To do this, I followed steps from here:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AMDGPU#Enable_Southern_Islands_(SI)_and_Sea_Islands_(CIK)_support

To get the amdgpu module to load before the radeon module, I created the file /etc/modprobe.d/amdgpu.conf with these contents:

	# load amdgpu driver before radeon driver
	options radeon	si_support=0
	options amdgpu	si_support=1
