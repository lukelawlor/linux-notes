* Fixing errors
To fix the "network default is not active" error in libvirt
#+begin_src shell
virsh net-start default
#+end_src

* Sharing files between the host and guest (where both run Linux)
Learned from [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7Bx4T5GvOs]]
I did this by using virtiofs. Steps:
1. In the hardware menu add a new filesystem
2. Set source path to the directory to share on the host
3. Set target path to a name to be used on the guest
4. Enable shared memory on the memory hardware
5. On the gentoo host, I had to install =app-emulation/virtiofsd=
6. In the guest, with root permissions, run =mount -t virtiofs target_path_name directory=
7. Win
