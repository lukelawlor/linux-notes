Most of this I found out from this link:

My messages and headers weren't being cached properly when I first started using this.

The fix was to create the account folder AND the cache folder inside of it beforehand. Then you have to make sure there are no slashes as the end of the headers and bodies settings in the account config.

remember to add this to your .profile or .bashrc for when you're asked for
your gpg password:
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)

1.11.24
If mutt hangs when trying to authenticate with XOAUTH2 and you don't see the login prompt, check if gpg is running in the background.
	If it is, kill it and trying logging in again.
	If it still doesn't work, make sure $GPG_TTY is set properly.

If you are using Gentoo, you can use `eselect pinentry` to change the user interface of the prompt for your GPG password. Selections include gtk, qt, curses and tty.
